<p align="center"> # NOTICE: </p>
<p align="center"> I am sad to announce that I am stepping down and stopping support/updates on my scripts or anything else on this repository [as I'm leaving this game for the forseeable future]. I do not like the direction this game seems to be heading lately. To me and this is just my opinion - [I feel like the game is heading more and more into just a cash grab for wiz with how he has been handling some things] and various other quips I am having with this game lately [and I've just been having major issues with my computer as well which doesn't help].. I am sorry to everyone who has been using my scripts, and I hope you all understand. I will be leaving this repository open to the public and will not be deleting it, so you are all free to still use my scripts or anything else in this repo, update them to make turn them into your own versions, or even fork this repo or whatever you please to do. I will still stick around the Adventure land discord chat for now to keep an eye on the direction of the game to get an idea on if I'll return or not. for the time being I'll try to answer questions or help if I can but main support for all this has ended.<p>
<p align="center"> I DO HOPE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND!</p>
