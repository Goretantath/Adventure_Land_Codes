# <p align="center"> # NEW NOTICE: </p>
<p align="center"> As some of you may recall, I have quit this game and decided to stop supporting/updating my repo, well after some thought and a few days I have decided to semi-comeback. I'm not coming back fully [as in I won't be playing the game.] as I still don't like the direction the game is currently going, but I will be updating my scripts from time to time [not as often as I was doing before though] and I will be semi-supporting my repo for now. if things change in the near future I will of course let you all know. </p>

Would like to thank for help on my codes/this repo/code snippits/testing things or whatever you may have helped with!
